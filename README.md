Web-Design-Challenge
For this homework I will be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment.
This web design challenge, will be focusing on HTML and CSS utilizing web dynamics on the topic of weather.

Latitude Analysis Dashboard
We'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in past projects. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Considerations
You may use the weather data or choose another dataset. Alternatively, you may use the included cities dataset and pull the images from the assets folder.
You must use bootstrap. This includes using the bootstrap navbar component for the header on every page, the bootstrap table component for the data page, and the bootstrap grid for responsiveness on the comparison page.
You must deploy your website to GitHub pages, with the website working on a live, publicly accessible URL as a result.
Be sure to use a CSS media query for the navigation menu.
Be sure your website works at all window widths/sizes.
Feel free to take some liberty in the visual aspects, but keep the core functionality the same.
Bonuses
Use a different dataset! The requirements above still hold, but make it your own.
Use a bootstrap theme to customize your website. You may use a tool like Bootswatch. Make it look snazzy, give it some attitude. If using this, be sure you also meet all of the requirements listed above.
Add extra visualizations! The more comparisons the better, right?
Use meaningful glyphicons next to links in the header.
Have visualization navigation on every visualizations page with an active state. See the screenshots below.
Screenshots
This section contains screenshots of each page that must be built, at varying screen widths. These are a guide; you can meet the requirements without having the pages look exactly like the below images.
